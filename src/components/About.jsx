            ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone, I'm Damiâ€”your friendly neighborhood frontend developer and JavaScript enthusiast, with aspirations of becoming a FullStack Software Engineer. When I'm not knee-deep in code, you can catch me indulging in my love for Anime, Movies, and Series, or scrolling through Twitter for the latest buzz. Building projects is where I truly thrive, especially during those serene late-night coding sessions, with nothing but the soft hum of music in the background. Intrigued? Let's connect on my socials and chat about all things tech and beyond!
